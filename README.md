# English-to-High-Valyrian-Python-Translator
Basically a English to High Valyrian translation program.

Created primarily in Python it's meant to take English as input (e.g. "Hello World!") and output it as High Valyrian like how it's rendered on Duolingo (w/ pronunciation and Glyphs).
Initially this program could only do Glyphs and as of the past couple days it's just not rendering what it is supposed to so any help/contributions are welcome.
Fork it yourself if you want to.
